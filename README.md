# Audio Signal Enhancement with Deep Learning

**Status:** Completed  
**Domain:** Machine Learning, Signal Processing  
**Tech Stack:** Python, TensorFlow (Keras), NumPy, Matplotlib

---

##  Overview
This project implements a **Denoising Autoencoder (DAE)** to enhance noisy audio signals.  
Audio data is represented as **spectrogram-like matrices**, allowing convolutional neural networks to learn noise-robust signal representations.

The project mirrors real-world data science workflows where unstructured signals must be cleaned before downstream analytics.

---

##  Methodology
- Converted signal enhancement into a **supervised learning problem**
- Used a **Convolutional Encoder–Decoder architecture**
- Trained the model to reconstruct clean spectrograms from noisy inputs
- Generated synthetic signals to ensure reproducibility and fast execution

---

##  Evaluation & Results
Performance was validated using **Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)**:

| Metric | Average SNR |
|------|------------|
| Noisy Input | ~2–3 dB |
| **Denoised Output** | **~14 dB** |
| **Net Improvement** | **+11 dB** |

Higher SNR confirms effective noise suppression.
